# Cloud-and-IoT-based-Health-Monitoring-System
This project is significant in various ways because in today's world, everyday many lives are affected because the patients are not timely and properly operated. Also for real time parameter values are not efficiently measured in clinic. Sometimes it becomes difficult for hospitals to frequently check patientâ€™s conditions. To deal with these types of situations, our system is beneficial. Our system is designed to be used in hospitals and homes also for measuring and monitoring various parameters like temperature, heart rate, blood pressure.
